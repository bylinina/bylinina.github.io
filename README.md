I am a linguist, interested in theoretical linguistics and in natural language processing. I am an Assistant Professor in Computational Linguistics (UD1, if you know the Dutch system) at Utrecht University, working in the [Language and Communication group](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-language-sciences/research/language-and-communication), part of the [Institute for Language Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-language-sciences). Before September 2024, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Groningen, Center for Language and Cognition (CLCG), [Computational Linguistics Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/). 

In Utrecht, I teach in the Applied Data Science master program and in the bachelor program Communication and Information Science. I am open to supervise (research) master theses in data science, AI and theoretical linguistics (semantics, mostly).

I wrote up a small thing that contains notes for my 'Linguistics for Language Technology' 2023 course at RuG. The course is over, but people seem to like the website, so if you are here for the course notes, [check them out](https://bylinina.github.io/ling_course/)!

I am a linguist, interested both in theoretical linguistics and in natural language processing. I am currently an NLP / ML engineer at Bookarang, Amsterdam.

Before, I worked at Leiden University Centre for Linguistics, leading my NWO VENI project called Number Words. In 2013-2016, I was a postdoc at the Meertens Institute, Amsterdam, working on cross-linguistic variation in morphosyntax of numerals. My dissertation entitled The Grammar of Standards [pdf] was written in Utrecht Institute for Linguistics OTS and defended in February 2014.

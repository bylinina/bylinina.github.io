I am a linguist, interested in theoretical linguistics and in natural language processing. I am an Assistant Professor (UD1, if you know the Dutch system) at Utrecht University, working in the [Language and Communication group](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-language-sciences/research/language-and-communication), part of the [Institute for Language Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/institute-for-language-sciences). Before September 2024, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Groningen, Center for Language and Cognition (CLCG), [Computational Linguistics Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/). 

<!--- 
Before, I was an NLP / ML engineer at [Bookarang](https://www.bookarang.com/en/), Amsterdam. Prior to that, I worked at Leiden University Centre for Linguistics, leading my NWO VENI project called Number Words. In 2013-2016, I was a postdoc at the Meertens Institute, Amsterdam, working on cross-linguistic variation in morphosyntax of numerals. My dissertation entitled The Grammar of Standards [[pdf]](http://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/296572/bylinina.pdf) was written in Utrecht Institute for Linguistics OTS and defended in 2014.

I wrote up a small thing that contains notes for my 'Linguistics for Language Technology' 2023 course at RuG. The course is over, but people seem to like the website, so if you are here for the course notes, [check them out](https://bylinina.github.io/ling_course/)!

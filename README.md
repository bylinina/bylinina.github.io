I am a linguist, interested both in theoretical linguistics and in natural language processing. I am currently an NLP / ML engineer at [Bookarang](https://www.bookarang.com/en/), Amsterdam.

Before, I worked at Leiden University Centre for Linguistics, leading my NWO VENI project called Number Words. In 2013-2016, I was a postdoc at the Meertens Institute, Amsterdam, working on cross-linguistic variation in morphosyntax of numerals. My dissertation entitled The Grammar of Standards [[pdf]](http://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/296572/bylinina.pdf) was written in Utrecht Institute for Linguistics OTS and defended in 2014.
